# next_word_predictor_lstm_streamlit

This is the streamlit application that is based on the topic History of Artificial Intelligence by using LSTM

# üß† Next Word Predictor

A smart and interactive **Streamlit web app** that uses an **LSTM-based deep learning model** to predict the next word(s) in a sentence. Just enter a starting phrase and let the model continue your thought!

## üåü Features

‚ú® **Deep Learning Powered**

- Uses an LSTM model built with TensorFlow and Keras
- Trained on a custom corpus to predict natural language sequences

üéØ **Interactive User Interface**

- Built using Streamlit for a sleek and responsive experience
- Clean dark mode UI with modern components

üìù **Text Completion Made Easy**

- Enter your own seed sentence
- Choose how many words to generate (1‚Äì20)
- Get smart predictions instantly

‚öôÔ∏è **Reusable & Extendable**

- Easily replace the model or tokenizer with your own
- Great for experimenting with text generation, chatbots, and NLP research
